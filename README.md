# TMDb Movies Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of a movie dataset obtained from [The Movie Database (TMDb)](https://www.themoviedb.org/). The analysis is performed using Python, focusing on exploring movie data, understanding trends, and deriving insights that can help in understanding the movie industry.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze the TMDb movies dataset to uncover patterns in movie production, profitability, and popularity. By applying various data analysis techniques, we aim to answer key questions about what makes a movie successful.

## Dataset

- **Source**: [Kaggle - TMDb Movies Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)
- **Description**: The dataset includes information about movies such as budget, revenue, genres, cast, crew, and release dates. It contains data on over 10,000 movies from TMDb.
